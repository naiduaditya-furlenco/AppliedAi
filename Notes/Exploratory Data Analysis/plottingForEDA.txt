//Refer to EDA notebook in this project for some examples and useful functions.


1). Three types of flowers considered in the iris dataset from the iris family:
	a). Iris Setosa
	b). Iris versicolor
	c). Iris virginica

2). Skewed/Unbalanced classes: When you have too many sample points of one class. Example: Diabetics vs Non diabetics. Total data points: 10,000 but only 200 diabetics, 9800 non-diabetics.

3). You can draw 2-D scatter plots as well as 3D scatter plots.

4). For interactive 3D scatter plots: https://plot.ly/pandas/3d-scatter-plots

5). Pair plots: Used to visualize data in higher dimensions.

6). You can use pair plots in seaborn to visualize higher dimension data like iris which is a 4-D data.

7). Limitations of pair plots: Number of graphs increases a lot with the dimensions of data. For data of dimension n, number of plots is nC2. Pair plots are useful only if dimensionality of data is very small.

8). 1D scatter plot are very hard to read (Example if you plot petal length on x axis and 0 on y axis. Points overlap a lot for different species.

Better to break it into smaller intervals --- Histogram.

Histogram: y axis is count in the given range.

Use seaborn to plot histograms.8). 1D scatter plot are very hard to read (Example if you plot petal length on x axis and 0 on y axis. Points overlap a lot for different species.

9). Probability distribution function: Smoothed version of histogram.

10). Density plots

11). Univariate analysis using probability density function (See video): Plot PDF for each feature on X axis and see if overlaps are there or not

12). Cumulative density functon can be used to estimate prediction accuracy: See image.
