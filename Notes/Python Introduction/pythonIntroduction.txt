1). Why python?

	- Easy to learn
	
	- Best packages for ML/AI makes coding simple
	
	- iPython notebooks (Can mix code with comments)
	
	- Extensively used in the industry.
	
2). Python keywords: Reserved words in python.

3). Python identifiers: Name given to entities like class, functions, variables etc,.

4). Variable and data types in python:

	- Don't need to declare data type of a variable when creating a variable.
	
	- Everything in python has a data type. Everything is an object in python.
	
	- Numbers: int, float, complex
	
	- String: Sequence of unicode characters with 0 based indexing. They are immutable.
	
	- List: Ordered sequence of items. (Can contain items of different data types at the same time). They are mutable. Declare: []
	
	- Tuple: Ordered sequence of items same as list but they are immutable. They cannot be changed once created. Declare:()
	
	- Set: Unordered collection of unique items. Declare: {}. We can perform operations like union, intersection etc,. Set objects do not
		  support indexing as they are unordered collection of items so we cannot access a particular element.
		  
	- Dictionary: Like a map or a hashtable to store key value pairs.
	
	- You can convert one data type to another like float to int. Also, one seuence to another like string to list of char.
	
5). Python Standard I/O

	
	- print  (doesn't work without prantheses. Used to work in earlier versions but not anymore.)
	
	- print().format() to format an output
	
	- num = input("Enter a number: ")
	
6). Python Operators

	-Logical: and, or, not
	
	-Bitwise ops:  a & b AND
				   a | b  OR
				   !a     NOT
	
    -is opertor:  a = 5  b= 5   a is b returns true
				  a = "aa" b= "aa" a is b return true
				  a = [1,2,3] b = [1,2,3] a is b returns FALSE
	
	
	-Membership operator is: Returns true if value present in sequence.	
			  
7). If, elif, else condition: 0, none and false are taken as false.	Everything else is considered as true.
